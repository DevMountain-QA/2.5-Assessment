# Checkpoint 2

## Setup

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub. Review previous assignments before asking for assistance with this step.
1. Clone that repository to your machine.
1. Add in the nightwatch files, a `tests` folder, and a `pageObjects` folder.
1. Add at least one test file to the `tests` folder.
1. Create a page object file in the `pageObjects` folder.

## Your Assignment

This project includes several small pieces of functionality.  We will be testing all of them!  Remember that to set up your testing, you can:

1. Plan WHAT should be tested.
   * Start with one test for each piece of functionality and get as far as you can, before you worry about testing the same piece multiple ways.
1. Put all the selectors you might need into the page object file.
   * Don't forget to include the URL for this applicaiton.
1. Plan HOW you can test these items.
   * You can put this information into JIRA if it will be helpful for you, but it is not required for this assessment.
1. Start writing your tests!
   * Don't settle for one test for each section of the app, write additional testing. 
      * Test something that is a palindrome as well as something that isn't.
      * Write a test that generates an error or a `null` value.
      * etc.
1. Save, add, commit, and push your tests using VS Code, git, and GitHub.

If you aren't sure where to get started, an easy way to organize your tests is to write your steps in comments, and then in code.

For example, based on the **Odds and Evens** bit of functionality:
```js
    'Odds and Evens' : browser => {
        //input numbers

        //click sort button

        //check even output

        //check odd output

    }
```

### Helpful NightwatchJS Commands

* `.click()` - we'll use this one
* `.setValue()` - we'll set that for sure
* `.expect.element().text.to.equal()` - just like testing the calculator...
* `.expect.element().text.to.contain()` - works exactly the same as the above, except that it looks for something to appear SOMEWHERE in the element's text, not for an exact match.  `{hello: 'world', goodnight: 'moon'}` could have a match for `hello` or `moon` if we used this command.

Look at the [NightwatchJS API docs for more details](http://nightwatchjs.org/api).

## Functionality

### Odds and Evens

This field will take a string of numbers and sort them into odd and even outputs.

### Filter Object

These objects can be filtered by entering any of their properties.  Only objects with that property will appear in the results.

### Filter String

From the listed strings, only those containing the string you input will appear in the results.

### Palindrome

Click the button to see whether the string you entered is, or is not, a palindrome.

### Sum

On the input lines, put in two numbers, click the button to see their sum.

## Contributions

If you see a problem or a typo, please fork, make the necessary changes, and create a pull request so we can review your changes and merge them into the master repo and branch.
